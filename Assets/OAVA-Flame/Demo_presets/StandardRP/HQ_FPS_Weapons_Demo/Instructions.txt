Here are presets used in the HQ FPS Animated Weapons video.

To use the post processing you need Post Processing v2 installed from the package manager and applied to the scene.

Convert object (e.g. box) to flammable just like in user_instructions.pdf, then apply preset to the FlammableObject.cs.

If your weapon (e.g. molotov) does not yet have a script to set the flammable object to fire, you need to add it.
- Add RaycastIgnite.cs component to your lingering fire/explosion particle system. 
- Modify the start offset by y = 2 or with highest position you want flames to reach. You can also modify raycast dir to y = 1 for raycasting up (depends on your setup which one you want).
- Modify the Raycast radius by amount you want flame to affect (e.g. 2)
- Done. Your weapon should ignite flames now.
- You can also use ParticleIgnite.cs if your weapon uses particles and has particle collions on.
