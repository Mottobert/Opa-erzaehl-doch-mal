The shader properties are generally used through script, 
but here is a small documentation to get you started in case you want to customize the shader.

_BaseMap to _Offset: Same as in Lit Shaders.
Mat_Alpha: Alpha of the material. Only clips the material out when alpha < Alpha threshold in opaque materials.
Fire_tile: Tiling of the flame effect
Fire_map: BaseMap texture for fire. Texture is included in package.
Fire_softness: Fresnel effect around the edges of the fire.
Fire_bright: 0-1, Lerps between fire_min_brightness and fire_max_brightness. How bright is the effect currently.
Fire_color: The color of the effect.
Voronoi_move: To produce the flashing, crackling fire effect, voronoi is used. This controls how fast it crackles.
Fire_dir: Which direction the fire is strongest. By default the fire is strongest on the top of the object.
Fire_side_multiplier: How much fire sides get compared to the top (fire_dir).
Fire_move_dir: For getting fire to life. It is moved just a little bit. This can be of course adjusted.
Fire_origin: Where is the origin point where fire caught up. The spread is calculated from this point.
Fire_spread: Distance in meters, how much has fire spread.
Fire_max_brightness: What is the max brightness the emission can reach. Adjust this if you cannot see the crackling effect.
Fire_min_brightness: What is the min brightness the emission starts. Adjust this if you cannot see the crackling effect.
Charred_wood_tex: The charred wood texture. Included in the package.
Charred_wood_blend: How much the charred wood is blended in the basemap
Charred_tiling: Tiling of the charred tex.
Charred_wood_normal: Normal map of the charred wood. Included in the package.
Charred_wood_normal_strength: Strength of the normal used.
