Fire_box parameters:
Spread: Sphere - fire spreading origin and radius.
Box: Box - Particle spawning box.
FlameColor: Color - Blended color to the flame
FireParticleMultiplier: Float - VFX amount multiplier.
FlameColorBlend: Float[0, 1] - How much FlameColor is blended to the final result 0-1.
FlameLength: Float - Average length of flame in seconds.
Rotation: Vector3 - Rotation of the spawn box.
BurnOutMultiplier: Float[0, 1] - Gradually changes the VFX to smaller amount if fire is burning out. 1 = full effect, 0 = no effect.
LODMaxDist: Float - Distance from the main camera when the effect is full AKA most particles AKA LOD0.
CullingDist: Float - Distance from the main camera when the effect is culled fully. The effect is gradually decreased between LODMaxDist and CullingDist.
WindForce: Vector3 - How much wind force is affecting the particles.
PutOutArea: Sphere - Extinguished area center and radius. Particles will die instantly on this area and never spawn.
SteamPos: Vector3 - Position to spawn the steam. 
FlameLiveliness: Float - How lively is the flames (Essentially a Drag of the living VectorField)
FlameSpeed: Float - How much force (natural upwards and wind) is applied to the flame (Essentially a Drag of Force)
SizeChangeRange: Vector2 - Min and Max multiplier of spawning box perlin noise size change.
BurstDelayRange: Vector2 - Min and Max of fire particle bursts. Seconds.
SmokeVFXMultiplier: Float - How much smoke there is compared to flames? LocalVFXMultiplier*global*SmokeMultiplier = total
SmokeAlpha: Float - Smoke Alpha multiplier
SmokeColor: Color - Color multiplier of the smoke
WindMultiplier: Float - How much wind affects the particle.
AdditionalCameraPosition: Vector3 - Additional culling camera position. Closest position between this and main camera is chosen
EmbersVFXMultiplier: float - Multiplier for general output of embers vfx.
EmbersBurstVFXMultiplier: float - Multiplier for ember burst which happens at EmbersBurstDelay intervals.
EmbersBurstDelayMinMax: Vector2 - x = min, y = max. min and max times for the ember burst random interval.
FlameParticleSize: float - How big are the fire particles.
EmbersParticleSize: float - How big are the ember particles.
FireVFXMultiplier: float - Local fire VFX multiplier. Only affects the flame flakes.

Fire_box Trigger events:
SteamBurst - Triggers steam burst to SteamPos
